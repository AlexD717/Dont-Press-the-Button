# Don't Press the Button

A main screen is shown on a display, with each player having a physical button in front of them. A timer randomly starts to count down, and the goal is to press the button as close to 0 as possible without going over. The player who gets closest to 0 gets a point; everyone who doesn't press the button in time loses a point. Everyone else gets 0 points.

## Gameplay Overview
- Countdown starts
- Players can press their button at any time during the countdown
- The closer to 0, the better
- Pressing after 0 is a penalty, and pressing too early earns nothing
